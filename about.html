                 <p><span>More than the profession, or a source of earning, Sports is the part of lifestyle. Be it matches, a day’s warm up or a leisure time with friends, Sports remain an indispensable part of the athletes. And we are lucky, that team of Vilasins is associated with people for whom SPORTS is in their DNA. Besides inherited religion from their ancestors, the other religion they believe in is SPORTS.

                  <br>Vilasins as a team, is proud of having mixed Sports enthusiasts, some are standing tall with international achievements. Some of them are ‘hero’ in their gully, offices, clubs. Some have left playing, but looking forward to fulfill their dreams through coaching. Some of them have been financially funded from parents to pursue Sports, while some of them are working hard to fulfill their athletic desires. A few of our team members have marked their names in Army, Navy, Airforce, Railways. While a few of them gave up Sports due to life situations, but still in tit bits they are carrying out their long lived love.
                  
                  <br>Our team may look dysfunctional, but it’s very functional it’s in own ways, because we touch lives through our own sweet Sporty emotions. Unbox the bundle of Sports knowledge, experience and motivation. Get connected with us to load up a lot of Sports positivity.</div>
